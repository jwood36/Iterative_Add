# Description
The code provided should iterate over a numeric range and output in sequential order the numbers.

# Problem
Currently the output of the program is:
    1
    3
    6
    10
    15
    21
    21

It should output each number between 1 and 20.  A double output of the final value is acceptable (refer to the double '21').

# Assignment
1. Identify the 'Why' the sequencing is not direct and has skips
	1. Must document line number that creates the problem.
2. Implement a solution with the iterative design to achieve a sequential output of numbers from 1 to 20
